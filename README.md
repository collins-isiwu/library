# library
Library is a web application built with Django that makes API calls to Google Book API in order to retrieve information about the searched book. It uses PostgreSQL to store and retrieve already searched books. Categorizes book and so much more.

### Nature of Project
My intention while programming is to showcase my python OOP and Django prowess. I wanted to make a Django project that is ready for production. Which is why I built the project within DOCKER. The database supporting this web application is POSTgreSQL!

#### Apps
This django project is made up of three apps namely:
1. accounts
2. bookstore
3. pages
4. ..
